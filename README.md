# Hi to my Repo!
Here a store all my config files for I3, picom, ect.
## I made two useful scripts:
- `upack.sh` to unpack all the config files to correct directories
- `pack.sh` to pack all the config files to correct directories

But of course, you need to install all needed programs to use them :D.

## Can I use them?
Feel free to copy them or take any ideas from it :D.
